: the main objective of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase by 2020 a mean length of healthy life in the EU for two years.
the partnership seeks to improve the quality of life of older people and to more effective health care solutions.
the use of innovation in a larger scale than this is now, in such areas such as health promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems, as well as assistant technology.
The Commission shall consult the consultation analysis to obtain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in different areas that impact on ageing in the current time.
further steps in the European Innovation Partnership on the basis of these responses are planned to be further developed in the European Innovation Partnership.
consultation is also discussed with the European Partnership Partnership for Innovation in the field of active and healthy ageing, which is held today in Brussels.
more than 150 representatives of interested parties discuss their views on it as to change partnerships to specific actions.
The European Partnership for Innovation Innovation Innovation Strategy, which is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to relocate ideas in jobs, environmental growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
: Europe's innovation has a three-starget objective: to allow Europe to achieve scientific results at world level, to significantly change the way of cooperation between public and private sectors, especially through innovation partnerships, and remove obstacles (such as costly patents, market fragmentation, slow implementation of standards and insufficient qualifications) which currently prevent rapid penetration of ideas on the market.

-term initiatives aimed at regional cooperation on nutrition cooperation should be strengthened as regards Asia, and initiatives should be strengthened.
: Harmonisation of EU intervention Access to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris declaration on the effectiveness of aid, the Action Programme of the EU Akkra and the Code of EU rules as regards the work of development policy.
and Member States should determine the regions and countries in relation to which they should split their work and coordinate their activities under the guidance of a particular major donor.
EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments that partner countries can help deal with food security problems.
more effective their measures should help to promote greater harmonisation of policies, more closely linked to instruments and coordination with private investors.
arity of policies for development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through the whole range of policy instruments including agriculture, trade, fisheries, combating climate change, environmental protection and research.
: This cohesion has been strengthened thanks to the reform of the common agricultural policy and future reforms will take account of the global food security targets.
furthermore, the future reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will increase cohesion of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods on the one hand and developing objectives on the other hand.
, in the last place, achieving balanced, complex and ambitious results of the development programme from Doha strengthened an international trade system, which should have a favourable impact on food security.
better align the coherence of the EU-Member States and Member States should better align the way to ensure food security in international scale managed and to support the accelerated reform of the Food Safety Committee in the world (CFS) which is the central authority in that area.
The Committee should seek to exercise the competence of supervision in other specific areas affecting food security, e.g. food aid and nutrition.
furthermore, the priorities of the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and the synergies should be improved, as well as their mutual cooperation.
The UN system reform and the ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are opportunities to increase quality and efficiency.

: It is not necessary that the question is raised by the parties themselves; the national judge may also be interpreted without the proposal.
: Reference for a preliminary ruling concerning interpretation Each court concerned has jurisdiction to refer the Court a question to the Court of Justice concerning the interpretation of Community law rules, provided that it considers necessary to resolve the dispute submitted to it.
, contrary to the court whose decision cannot be challenged by remedies under national law, it is essentially obliged to submit a question to the Court of Justice, unless there is a case-law in that area (and any new framework does not find actual doubts as to the possibility of applying that case-law) or is the correct method of interpretation of the Community rules is clearly clear.
, in particular, where the case is sufficiently clarified on the basis of the case-law of the Court, the Court of First Instance itself has the right interpretation of Community law and its application for the facts made.
: However, the reference for a preliminary ruling may show, in a suitable stage of the procedure, as particularly useful, if it is a new issue of interpretation of the general importance for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or where the case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
the national court is of the view to explain what the requested interpretation is necessary to order its judgment.
/or the application for a preliminary ruling concerning the assessment of the validity of the national courts Where the national courts have the opportunity to declare the Community act as invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
, in so far as the Court of Justice has doubts as to the validity of the Community measure, the reference to the reference for a preliminary ruling, in so far as it considers that Community act could be capable of being invalid.
, however, if the national court has serious doubts as to the validity of the Community act based on a national act, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of the latter act or in that regard any other interim measures.
The question referred for the validity of the Court and to state reasons why it considers that Community acts are not valid.
The Court may submit a reference for a preliminary ruling from the national court before the Court of Justice, as soon as it finds that the decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to enable the judgment to be delivered; it is a national court which can best assess the extent to which the procedure is to be lodged.
, however, it is desirable that the decision to refer the questions referred for a preliminary ruling is adopted in the proceedings where the court is able to define the facts and legal framework of the problem so as to enable the Court to have all the information necessary to verify that Community law is applicable to the main proceedings.
can also be shown in order to properly execute justice, to ask the question referred for a preliminary ruling after the contractor discussion of the case.
: As a reference for a preliminary ruling The decision of the decision on which the national court considers the question referred for a preliminary ruling from the Court, may be adopted in any form which national law permits for procedural issues in the case of procedural issues.
, however, it is important to be considered that this document which is the basis for the proceedings which will be carried out before the Court and that the Court must have the information available to him to provide the national court with a useful answer.

Annex IV, Part 2 shall be replaced by the following:
‘CLAST 2 Veterinary certification for the import of consignments of eggs and embryos and goats EN Official Journal of the European Union L 252/s3 ORLEMENTATION OF THE TENERAL PROVISIONS From 1 July 2013 the method of reference to acts has changed.
new and current mode will be used during the transitional period.
The achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) should not be compromised by Member States which infringe its rules.
Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) is a financial assistance from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (ENDF) subject to compliance with the rules of the CRP by Member States.
failure to comply with the rules of the CFP Member States may result in interruptions or suspension of payments or execution of financial corrections granted to the Union under the CRP.
. 83(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) lay down the conditions under which payment time limit can be imposed and Article 142(1) of the same payment suspension regulation.
, those two articles provide that, in relation to the failure to comply with the rules under the CRP, specific rules for the ESRF may lay down specific grounds for interruptions and suspension of payments.
in order to protect the financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers where the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the CRP or where the Commission has evidence indicating such failure, the Commission has the possibility to interrupt payment deadlines under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.
. In addition to the suspension of payment deadlines and to avoid the risk of payment of unfair expenditure, the Commission may, in the event of serious failure to comply with the CRP rules in accordance with Article 101 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, suspend payment.
the financial consequences of sanctions imposed by the Member States, if they fail to comply with the rules of the CRP, the duration and repeat of the rules should be proportionate to the nature, severity, duration and repeat of the rules.
: In order to ensure legal certainty for Member States implementing operational programmes under the ESF, it is necessary to define cases of failure to comply with the CRP rules essential for the conservation of marine biological resources which may, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, lead to the suspension of payment deadlines or suspension of payments.
: Without prejudice to any other sanctions imposed by the CRP rules, these cases will be used for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 and the implementation of Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
: (a) the consequences of failure to comply with the CRP rules which are essential to maintain biological resources should be considered to be serious if the Member State has not taken the necessary measures to remedy the situation which led to the suspension of payment deadline.
Before the interruption or suspension of payments, the Commission must adopt implementing acts pursuant to Article 100(2) and Article 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, which further clarifies the failure to fulfil obligations under the CRP by the Member State which may affect expenditure required by the interim payment.
in the first day following publication in the Official Journal of the European Union , HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
: Article 1 The cases of failure to comply with the rules In the Annex to this Regulation are laid down in cases of failure to fulfil obligations of a Member State under the CRP which may lead to the suspension of payment period relating to the interim payment application pursuant to Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.

, if the 10-year limitation period should start running until the transfer of APSA vaccine to the Ministry of Health, the exact moment of the sale of APMSD to the Ministry of Healthcare should be determined to determine the starting date of the limitation period.
: If, in this case, the limitation period for APSA should be interrupted in time by bringing proceedings against APMSD ( 36 ) it would be initiated before the expiry of the 10-year period if the marketing of the Ministry of Health was initiated until the expiry of 16 October 1992 ( 37 )
, even if no longer possible to establish the precise moment of selling the medical ministry vaccine was possible, and it would only be possible to define it for the period between 22 September 1992 – the date of adoption of vaccine vaccines in APMSD – and on 3 November 1992 – the defendant – would start proceedings against APSA on 16 October 2002 in any event, the limitation period of time was interrupted in time.

If APSA could only define this moment as a specific period starting over 10 years before the application is brought, but it ends less than 10 years before the administration, APSA would not have, as not only the burden of proof, but also the probative risk of determining the precise moment of the start of the limitation period.

: European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries and the South Caucasus 2.2.1.
The current framework for dialogue Framework for relations with Eastern Europe countries and the South Caucasus is the European Neighbourhood Policy.
, although the cooperation on migration, visa issues, asylum policies, border management and other related economic and social issues are indirectly mentioned by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which forms the legal basis of the EC Treaty with those countries, these topics are also included in all European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans agreed with the Eastern Partners.
, some of these partner countries also have their own national action programmes in this context.
: In the case of Ukraine there is a specific action plan for justice, freedom and security, which corresponds to the parts of this area in the Action Plans negotiated with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova, and the Commission also cooperates with Ukraine on the basis of the evaluation results based on the Actual Plan on Justice, Freedom, freedom and Security, which is the direct point.
on migration issues, with Moldova and Ukraine, in the relevant subcommittees, are also discussed at regular meetings of the EU-Ukrain Ministerial Triple for Justice, Security and Justice, as well as at the meetings of the Cooperation Committee and of the Cooperation Council.
The similar approach follows in the case of three countries of the South Caucasus whose action plans were adopted in November 2006.
and cooperation with individual countries is progressing different tempes, according to their ability, size (which applies particularly in Ukraine) and situations.
, although Belarus is a special case[7], technical cooperation on border policy issues, migration and organised crime may be based on contacts with Belarus’s staff at work level and within regional dialogue and regional programmes.

The Commission intends to submit a Committee on noise referred to in Article 13 of the Directive to the work programme containing certain of the following elements.
if necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will give rise to judicial proceedings to supplement the active implementation of the activities described below.
: Completion of the harmonised framework for mapping methods Despite improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is far ideal is far from the ideal.
ing the current assessment is apparent that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
the problems are linked, inter alia, different data collection methods, quality and availability of data and the methods used, evaluating.
: This is the cause of various results in the EU Member States.
The comparability required will ultimately lead to the harmonisation of methods(s) that will reflect the sectoral specifications sufficiently.
The Commission started working on the development of harmonised noise exposure methods (under Article 6(2)), in 2008 (with Article 6(2)).
The project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common noise assessment method) which leads to the Joint Research Centre, shall ensure a technical basis for the preparation of the Commission Implementing Decision.
, provided that technical work in 2011, the Commission considers possible revision of Annex II to the Rural Area Directive (which is the opinion of the Committee in 2011).
-depth and sectoral specifications, such as data requirements as data requirements should be assessed in the harmonised methodological framework and should be carefully balanced and carefully balanced.
The Commission intends to propose a joint work programme of the Commission/European Environment/Member States for the implementation of the CNOSSOS-EU project for 2012-2015, in order to be operational for the third cycle of reporting in 2017.
and/or leaving space for different interpretations and implementation of the Directive to the development of implementing guidelines The EU number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaving the scope for different interpretations and implementation.
Many Member States have proposed that these issues are addressed through specific actions that help implement and compliance with EU level, e.g. the development of documents with guidance, exchange of information on best practices or organising special workshops and training courses.
: Mapping methods and best mapping procedures, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and response, calculation of repeated exposures, the creation of action plans and permissible or target values.
The Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs and the costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen in the context of this procedure.

ing legal and fiscal environment that is favourable for businesses To make use of all opportunities offered by the Single Market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the Single Market is based, simpl, adapted and must match the problems encountered by businesses in daily activities.
: Measures proposed in this section are calculated, inter alia, by reducing administrative and regulatory burden, with positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
: In this context, very concrete initiatives will be adopted to ensure mutual links between trade companies and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
arity is also essential to the fiscal issues.
to limit administrative burden on undertakings and facilitate their cross-border activities.
further, the specific attention of the defence and security sector, as they encourage development and growth throughout the economy as a result of their top technologies, innovation and know-how.
: Proposal No 19 : The Commission will adopt initiatives to improve coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular the proposal for a directive to establish a common consolidated basis of corporate taxation (CZZS) in 2011.
and more than 27 existing national tax systems in the EU are large differences, creating significant fiscal obstacles to cross-border activities of companies or even preventing that activity.
arity leads to significant market distortions and to the cost of placing in accordance with the rules of law.
: In particular SMEs, which often have the necessary means to overcome these deficiencies, and it may discourage them from developing the single market.
ing the common consolidated basis of taxation of companies is to address the problem of fiscal provisions which limit growth.
companies should only follow a single set of rules in fiscal matters and should act only with one fiscal administration across the EU (“single contact point”).
should be consolidated at the group level and losses should be deducted from profits irrespective of the border, regardless of the border.
ions of double taxation or double exemption from tax due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal rules would be excluded in relations within groups.
non-coordinated measures at national level would only reproduce the current situation, since companies would still be confronted with the total of fiscal systems, how many states in which those companies operate.
In that regard, it must be recalled that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that, if the resolution authority adopts a report concerning the uncontested measures, the Council may, if it considers appropriate, cancel or amend the contested measures or adopt other appropriate specific measures to take account of legal interpretations in the formulated.
The European Union institutions may consider appropriate to repeal or amend the measures adopted under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution proceedings within the framework of the Memorandum Agreement on rules and procedures governing dispute resolution, or adopt other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the resolution authority.
second, as the applicant correctly states, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the objective of those provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, such as the case in the basic Regulation adopted to fulfil international obligations arising from the anti-dumping Agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

The Court of First Instance, by failing to establish Article 2 of the Decision on the Community composition, which provides for an unlawful criterion for the choice of procedural conditions to be respected, under the appellant, in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, that the regulatory procedure can only be applied for measures with general scope.
– Arguments The Commission 43 The Commission considers that the reference to the thirtieth recital of Regulation No 3319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of that regulation, which imposes specific duties if two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP product.
The Commission contests that the Court of First Instance submits that the regulatory procedure can only be applied for measures with general scope.
: Conclusions 45 Both parts of the examination of the appeal and, therefore, the reason for appeal itself does not have a separate existence.
, as the Advocate General points 41 of his Opinion, both parts of the examination of the appeal are more specifically raised within the fourth, respecting the third ground of appeal, which is challenged by its own legal analysis carried out by the Court.
48, that part of the ground of appeal is therefore consistent with the fourth, respected with the third ground of appeal.
49 Consequently, it must not be examined separately.
The appeal alleging distortion of the facts Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF claim that the Court of First Instance, in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, adopted a totally fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities regarding the existence of an indirect invoice.

, in that regard, it is sufficient that that the common component is not negligible.
The Court of First Instance stated that, second, that the overall impression which triggered the mark applied for is dominated by the element ‘creaciones kennya’, which the consumer concerned focuses on a broad degree of attention and, second, in particular, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the element ‘ck’ element in relation to the element ‘creaciones kennya’ is merely an interior position, which, in essence, the conclusion that ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
The Court of First Instance, which, on the basis of the correct analysis, excluded any similarity between the marks and in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, concluded that, despite the good name of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
: 59 Third part of the first ground of appeal, it must therefore be declared unfounded.
In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 when it did not examine the good name of the earlier marks under that provision.
2 The Court of First Instance held that, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the applicant claims that the applicant claims a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, while the action was expressly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation.
63 The Court of First Instance committed an error of law, finding that, since the marks at issue were similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of the earlier marks.
: The fact that the earlier mark of CK Calvin Klein is generally known, should be taken into account in order to determine whether it is necessary to grant more extensive protection.
good name of the earlier mark must be assessed when assessing similarity between marks conflicting marks and not after similarity has been demonstrated.
In that regard, the appellant submits that, if the proprietary mark of the cK was protected only if the third parties of the ‘cK’ would have used the same way of graphic representation, it would mean that the CK trade mark with a good name was granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection that would have been used if it were not generally known.
the fact that the trade mark of cK and other distinct graphical representation of those letters are famous, conferred on them against the use of the ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, as that point identifies Calvin Klein Klein, thereby producing their use by a third party through associations.
The Court of First Instance held that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held that, in the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance held the right to the question of a good name of the earlier mark.
. whereas the signs at issue cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 does not apply.
66 Zafra Marroquineros states that, in the judgment under appeal, the reference to the good name of the earlier marks is made in the judgment under appeal.

the detailed rules for the implementation of this system should be laid down.
/decision checks may be completed before receiving payment and annual premiums provided for in Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
in particular where such checks cannot be completed before receiving such payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative penalties should be exempted in accordance with this Regulation or by starting.
The rules relating to authorities in Member States responsible for the control of the obligations of conditional compliance with the Member States should be laid down in accordance with the rules on the authorities responsible for the control system of the conditionality obligation.
should be established for the minimum level of controls for verification of the requirement for conditionality.
imum 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and who must be selected on the basis of appropriate risk analysis.
for the purpose of calculating the control sample, in the specific case of a group of persons pursuant to Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, the Member States should be granted flexibility in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or each member of the group individually.
Member States should be able to choose whether to meet the minimum level of controls at each relevant supervisory authority, at the level of the paying agency or at the level of act or standards, or a set of acts or standards.
where specific legislation applicable to acts or standards provides for minimum controls, Member States should comply with those rates.
, however, Member States should be allowed to apply a uniform level of controls on the spot on conditionality.
and subsequently, in accordance with the sectoral legislation, all cases of mismatch established during the verification of the site under sectoral legislation should be reported and subsequently monitored under conditionality.
: in order to simplify as regards the requirement for conditionality in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of selection of the monitoring plans should be considered to be fulfilling the requirement of a minimum degree set out in this Regulation.
Member States should be provided flexibility necessary to achieve the minimum control rate by using the results from other inspections on the spot or substitution of beneficiaries.
in order to avoid the weakening of the control system, in particular as regards the selection of samples for the verification of the site relating to conditionality, should not take account of subsequent controls carried out in relation to de minimis rule pursuant to Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
finding a significant degree of non-compliance in connection with conditionality should lead to increased the number of inspections at the following year to achieve acceptable level of security as regards the accuracy of the aid applications concerned.

The analysis of basic factors and the fact that the reference value is complied with with a wide range, confirm the positive outcome on the price stability criteria.
The following criterion is met by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Sweden.
public finances – public debt and deficit level The Lithuania currently does not apply to Council Decision on the existence of excessive deficit (under Article 126(6) of the Treaty) of excessive deficit (under Article 126(6) of the Treaty).
GDP deficit ratio fell from 5.5% in 2011 to 2.1% in 2013 and, according to the Commission’s Economic Forecasts 2014 the Commission’s 2014 deficit is to remain at 2.1% at 2.1% in 2014 at 2,1 %.
total public debt at the end of 2013 was 39.4% of GDP – it is significantly less than the Maastricht Limits.
The criterion also meets Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Sweden.
: The Czech Republic will also meet this criterion if the Council decides to repeal the excessive deficit procedure as proposed by the Commission.
: two Member States (Croatia and Poland) are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure and that criterion does not meet.
the exchange rate stability In the currency exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II) is a exchange rate of a Member State which is not a member of the euro area, is linked to the euro and can only be fluctuated within the limits set (standard fluctuating zone in the margin of  ⁇ 15% from the median course).
The Lithuania is a member of the ERM II from 28 June 2004.
24/76 Litas was exposed to any pressure during the two-year reference period and no distinction from the ERM II Central Course.
: this criterion does not meet one other country, since no other Member State is a member of the ERM II member.
